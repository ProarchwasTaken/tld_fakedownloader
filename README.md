# tld_fakedownloader
I made a file installer simulation in python.

So I learned how to find a percentage of something in math class on calculator not on paper yet. I all had to do is divide and multiply by decimals I think. I had to do it to find what is like 10 percent of 50 or something. I then realized I could do that in python so I quickly made a program that simulates downloading files.

You can set a file size and download speed and both of these factors will determine how long a download takes. It also informs you if a certain percentage of the download is complete too so you're not completely in the dark!

I prepared an .exe file if you don't have python. I also included the .py of course!
